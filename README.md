# monster_cards

This is a small sample Flutter project that loads monster stats from a repository. The stats are displayed as a scrollable list of cards with thumbnail. 
The back-end was implemented fully test-driven.

The project uses _getIt_ for dependency injection and _bloc_ for state management.

The design was inspired by: https://github.com/sergiandreplace/flutter_planets_tutorial/tree/master
